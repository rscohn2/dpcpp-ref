 Introduction
==============

Obtaining high compute performance on todayâ€™s modern computer
architectures requires code that is optimized, power efficient, and
scalable. The demand for high performance continues to increase due to
needs in AI, video analytics, data analytics, as well as in traditional
high performance computing (HPC).

Modern workload diversity has resulted in a need for architectural
diversity; no single architecture is best for every workload. A mix of
scalar, vector, matrix, and spatial (SVMS) architectures deployed in
CPU, GPU, AI, and FPGA :term:`accelerators <accelerator>` is required
to extract best performance.

Today, coding for CPUs and accelerators requires different languages,
libraries, and tools. There is limited application code reusability
across different target architectures.

`oneAPI`_ is a cross-industry initiative for an open, standards-based
unified programming model that creates a common developer experience
across compute accelerator architectures. Its objective is to deliver
an efficient, performant programming model that eliminates the need
for developers to maintain separate code bases, languages, tools, and
workflows for each architecture.

Overview
========

oneAPI consists of Data Parallel C++ (DPC++) and a core set of
libraries for compute-intensive domains. DPC++ programs accelerate a
sequential computation by distributing work across the processing
elements in a device.  DPC++ uses a data parallel programming
model. The data is distributed across a set of processing elements,
and each processing element operates on the data in parallel. By using
a data parallel programming model, the developer is able to scale the
parallelism with the size of the data.

A developer can either use DPC++ to explicitly parallelize an
algorithm, or use a parallel implementation from a oneAPI
library. oneAPI makes it possible to target CPU, GPU, or FPGA with a
single implementation by providing consistent interfaces. However,
some devices may not implement all features. Achieving best
performance often requires the programmer to tune the code for the
target architecture. oneAPI libraries are written to achieve best
performance on all supported architectures without end user tuning.

As shown in the figure above, applications that take advantage of the
oneAPI programming model can execute on multiple target hardware
platforms ranging from CPU to FPGA. 


Data Parallel C++ (DPC++)
=========================

DPC++ is the heart of oneAPI. DPC++ programs are written in ISO C++
and use the Khronos\* `SYCL`_\* parallel programming model to distribute
computation across processing elements in a device. DPC++ extends SYCL
with features for performance and productivity.

DPC++ is :term:`single source` -- device and host code can be included
in the same source file. A DPC++ compiler generates code for both the
host and device. Any C++ compiler can compile programs that only use
the host subset of DPC++.

In this guide, it is safe to assume that anything that mentions SYCL is also applicable to DPC++. Anything specific to DPC++ will be explicitly mentioned.

Structure of This Document
==========================

This document consists of the following sections: 

* :ref:`oneapi-programming-model` describes the high-level concepts
  for the DPC++ programming model and the execution model that it
  depends upon.
* :ref:`programming-interface` provides a detailed explanation of the
  classes that make up the programming model.

How to Use This Document
========================

This document is a reference manual for DPC++. It is intended to be
the document to consult when you are coding an algorithm in DPC++ and
need to understand the detailed functionality, usage of an API, or
some other aspect of DPC++.

If you want to learn DPC++, the `oneAPI online
training`_ is more appropriate. The ultimate sources for DPC++
information are the `oneAPI Specification`_ and the `SYCL
Specification`_. The specifications are written for implementors of
oneAPI elements and SYCL compilers/runtimes. The descriptions are more
precise, but may be difficult to understand if you are not already an
expert in other aspects of DPC++.
